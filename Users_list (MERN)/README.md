## Description

I have successfully developed a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack application for database management. MongoDB is employed for data storage on the backend, while the frontend utilizes React.js. The application effectively integrates server data and offers advanced filtering capabilities based on various data parameters, such as name, gender, availability, and domain.
