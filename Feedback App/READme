The project is to be focused on collecting feedback from users and displaying statistics based on the feedback received.

The project consists of the following components:

FeedBackForm: This component renders a form where users can provide feedback. It includes a rating select component
(RatingSelect) and an input field for the feedback text. Users can submit the form by clicking the "Send" button. 
The component manages the form state using React hooks (useState). It also performs validation on the feedback text 
and enables/disables the submit button based on the validation result.

FeedBackItem: This component represents an individual feedback item. It displays the rating, feedback text, and a delete button.
The component is used to render each feedback item in the application. When the delete button is clicked,
it triggers a callback function (handleDelete) provided by the parent component.

FeedBackStats: This component displays statistics based on the feedback received. It calculates the average
rating by summing up all the ratings and dividing by the total number of feedback items.
The average rating is displayed along with the total number of reviews.

RatingSelect: This component renders a list of radio buttons representing rating options from 1 to 10.
Users can select a rating by clicking on the corresponding radio button. The selected rating is managed using React hooks (useState).
It also calls a callback function (select) provided by the parent component to update the selected rating.

The project is to be focused on gathering user feedback, storing it in an array, and displaying it along with relevant statistics. 
The handleAdd and handleDelete functions are likely implemented in the parent component to manage the feedback data and update the UI accordingly.
